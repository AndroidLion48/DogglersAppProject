I built an app called Dogglers that displays information in a RecyclerView using the skills you learned in Unit 2 through gained knowledge of layouts to build a scrollable dog photo app in Android Studio, and run tests against my code to make sure everything works as expected.

## AndroidLion's Notes:


Skills I practiced completing this project:

* Googling terms, error messages, and bits of code in the app that you don't recognize;
* Testing code, reading errors, then making changes to the code and testing it again;
* Referencing previous content in Android Basics to refresh what you've learned;
* Comparing code that you know works (i.e. code that is given in the project, or past solution code from other apps in Unit 2) with the code you're writing.


Skills displayed in project:

    * Using RecyclerView
    * Package organization
    * Using Adapters 
    * Working with collections
    * Gradle build and Imports
    * View binding for UI interaction
    * Resource management
    * String management
    * Code optimization and refactoring
    * Debugging and testing
    * Algorithm creation
    * Calling and importing methods
    * Using conditional statements
